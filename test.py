# The test.py reads a folder named ‘testPatient’ and outputs two folders. One folder named “Slices” and another folder named ‘’Boundaries’.
# ‘Slices’ folder will further have ‘N’ number of folders where N is number of images that ends with “thresh”.
# for example, in the given data we have N=112 (‘testPatient’ will have different ‘N’). Every image folder should contain the brain slices images of that IC_thresh image.
# Similarly, another folder “Boundaries” will also have N number of folders and every folder will have boundary highlighted images of that IC_thresh image.
